I'll smile, I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down
And all through the night time, oh yeah,
Oh, yeah, I'll tell you what you want to hear
Keep my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time, yeah, yeah

I'll put my armor on,
Show you how strong I am
I'll put my armor on,
I'll show you that I am
